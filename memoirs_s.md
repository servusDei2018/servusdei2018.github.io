# Sophia

I first got to know Sophia roughly in March of 2020, when I invited her to come to the TAC summer program.  We got to know each other better in the course of three-hundred-something messages, and flirted too. I couldn't imagine - and still can't - a more wonderful person, with whom I'd gladly spent life and eternity, a friend if nothing more.

Months passed as we got to know each other, and I loved her greatly. I could not find fault in her. I learned a ton about her, that she had hodgkins lymphoma, had undergone therapy (May 13 2020 was the one year anniversary), and that her birthday was 22 April 2003. The more I learned, the more I loved.

Eventually I, upon learning that she would be unable to make it to the summer program, invited her to come down for a trip on the Appalachian. I really longed to be with her in person. That was a pure love - I loved her for what she was and not for what she could do for me; I adored her and wanted to be at her side. I wrote her poems, one about Radonitsa, which intrigued me - she was my inspiration.

I joined the CH discord server in late May I think. Shortly after, Mr. Warren cracked down on our PM on CH so we started conversing on discord. There being no rules, I soon got myself into trouble.

I loved Sophia and did many stupid things. One day, after hearing that she'd been up late at night (12 PM here, 4 AM here) I stayed awake and that night was up at 4 AM too. I don't want to blame it on drowsiness; I had lust, and my speech was shameful. Sadly I went mostly unreprimanded. This was to make matters worse, for now not only love but lust was in the picture.

Not long after, discotheque
