  <h2>Definitions</h2>

  <div id='definitions'>
    
    <div id='movement'>
      
      <a name='movement'>Movement:</a> 
      The MOVEMENT from <a href="index.html#potentiality">POTENTIALITY</a> to
      <a href="index.html#actuality">ACTUALITY</a>.
    
    </div>
    
    <br />
    
    <div id='potentiality'>
      
      <a name='potentiality'>Potentiality:</a>
      When we say that a thing is POTENTIALLY A, we mean that it can be 
      <a href="index.html#actuality">ACTUALLY</a> so.
    
    </div>
    
    <br />
    
    <div id='actuality'>
      
      <a name='actuality'>Actuality:</a>
      That which is [so].
      
    </div>
    
    <br />
    
    <div id='change'>
      
      <a name='change'>Change:</a>
      A substance, comprised of both <a href="index.html#matter">MATTER</a>
      and <a href="index.html#form">FORM</a> which is the <a href="index.html#potentiality">
      POTENTIAL</a> bearer of qualities which successively become <a href="index.html#actuality">
      ACTUALLY</a> so. This is how change occurs.
      
    </div>
    
    <br />
    
    <div id='matter'>
      
      <a name='matter'>Matter:</a>
      Evident. For instance, that which goes into the making of a house.
      
    </div>
    
    <br />
    
    <div id='form'>
      
      <a name='form'>Form:</a>
      That by which <a href="index.html#matter">MATTER</a> is characterized. Immaterial.
      
    </div>
    
    <br />
    
    <div id='substance'>
      
      <a name='substance'>Substance:</a>
      The union of both <a href="index.html#matter">MATTER</a> and <a href="index.html#form">
      FORM</a> An example of substances: atoms, which carry qualities, and, like any substance,
      account for <a href="index.html#change">CHANGE</a>.
      
    </div>
    
    <br />
    
  </div>
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
  <h2>Statements</h2>
  
  <div id='statements'>
    
    1. Evident to the senses is <a href="index.html#motion">MOTION</a>. [That which does not
    exist (<a href="index.html#potentiality">POTENTIALS</a>) become so (<a href="index.html#movement">
    MOVEMENT</a>)
    <br />
    2. That which is so (<a href="index.html#actuality">ACTUALITIES</a>) <a href="index.html#potentiality">
    POTENTIALLY</a> continues to be so. For that which is so can in fact continue to be so.
    <br />
    3. Conversely, that which is so is <a href="index.html#potentiality">potentially</a> so in
    a different way (it may <a href="index.html#change">CHANGE</a>).
    <br />
    4. That which is <a href="index.html#potentiality">POTENTIAL</a> cannot be its own efficient
    cause, that is, that which in fact could be so, cannot, since it is not so, be so. [This does
    not refer to that which is so, but that <a href="index.html#potentiality">POTENTIAL</a>
    of continuing to be so, which is not so.]
    <br />
    5. Thus, since we are so, a Thing must be so of which it is so (an eternal Thing) and for
    which it is so eternally: an eternal <a href="index.html#substance">SUBSTANCE</a>. For,
    without this eternal substance to cause us (and all that is so) to be so, nothing could be 
    so. That Thing men call God.
